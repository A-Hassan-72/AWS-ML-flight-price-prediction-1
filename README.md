## Flight Price Prediction using AWS SageMaker

An end-to-end Machine Learning project implemented on AWS SageMaker, demonstrating the full lifecycle of a data science workflow — from raw data to a deployed ML web application.

This repository contains my personal implementation of the project, completed while learning and applying cloud-based ML engineering skills. Unlike a toy example, this project is built with production readiness in mind, leveraging AWS services and MLOps best practices.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict flight ticket prices based on various factors such as airline, departure/arrival time, duration, source, and destination.

##### What makes this project stand out:

- End-to-End Pipeline → Data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, deployment, and monitoring.

- Cloud-Native → Entire ML workflow managed with AWS SageMaker, S3, IAM, and EC2.

- Production Deployment → A Streamlit web app hosted on cloud, making predictions accessible via an intuitive interface.

- Scalable & Reproducible → Modularized code with pipelines (scikit-learn transformers, SageMaker processing jobs).

## Project Workflow

#### Data Preparation

- Collected and cleaned dataset using Pandas & NumPy

- Handled missing values, outliers, categorical encoding, and feature scaling

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted statistical analysis & hypothesis testing

- Generated visualizations (univariate, bivariate, multivariate) to uncover insights

#### Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

- Created custom scikit-learn transformers for categorical and numerical features

- Built preprocessing pipelines with Pipeline, FeatureUnion, ColumnTransformer

- Model Training & Optimization

- Performed Feature Selection to identify the most predictive variables.

- Trained  regression model (XGBoost) on AWS SageMaker

- Hyperparameter tuning using SageMaker’s built-in capabilities and also using Optuna in local environment

#### Model Deployment

- Saved model artifacts to S3

- Integrated with a Streamlit Web App for real-time predictions

#### Web Application

- Built a Streamlit-based UI for interactive predictions

- Users can enter flight details (airline, date, duration, etc.) and instantly get price predictions

- Deployed app on the cloud for public access

## Tech Stack

- Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

- AWS Services: SageMaker, S3, EC2, IAM

- MLOps Tools: SageMaker Pipelines, Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs and Optuna

- Deployment: Streamlit Web App
